'''
You are given a string A of size N.
Print the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:
- A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
- Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
- If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
